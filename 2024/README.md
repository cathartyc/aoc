# AoC 2024 edition - Rust

The goals for the 2024's edition are:
- solve the puzzles in Rust
- solve them in Neovim, and try debugging without VS Code
- don't look at other people's solutions
- don't use any LLM to complete the whole puzzle (using it for small parts is fine IMO)
- use the remaining time to study for university
- drink more water (you should too)
