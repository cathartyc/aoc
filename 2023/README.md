# AoC 2023 edition - Rust

The goals for the 2023's edition are:
- solve the puzzles in Rust
- actually learn Rust by doing that
- ditch VS Code in favor of Neovim (this includes debugging)
- **DO NOT** use ChatGPT to help myself in any case (no need to learn how to ask questions)
- most importantly, do not overburn over a problem: no one is gonna fire me for being late. I do not need a second job, I need to have fun

(Actually, I sucked at thisðŸ¤¡. Lesson learned: Rust is not ez and requires some time to learn how to do even the most basic stuff. Next year I should definitely invest more time in studying its theory.)
