# Advent of Code

My own attempts to solve the AoC daily puzzles. Unsolved puzzles from past years are considered as TODO.

The goals for the 2024's edition are:

- solve the puzzles in Rust
- solve them in Neovim, and try debugging without VS Code
- don't look at other people's solutions
- don't use any LLM to complete the whole puzzle (using it for small parts is fine IMO)
- use the remaining time to study for university
- drink more water (you should too)

The goals for the 2023's edition were:
- solve the puzzles in Rust
- actually learn Rust by doing that
- ditch VS Code in favor of Neovim (this includes debugging)
- **DO NOT** use ChatGPT to help myself in any case (no need to learn how to ask questions)
- most importantly, do not overburn over a problem: no one is gonna fire me for being late. I do not need a second job, I need to have fun

Actually, I sucked at thisðŸ¤¡. Lesson learned: Rust is not ez and requires some time to learn how to do even the most basic stuff. Next year I should definitely invest more time in studying its theory.

The goals for the 2022's edition were:

| Goal | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| solve the puzzles in Python 3.10 | done 15/25 |
| learn to write better 'pythonic' code | maybe done |
| do it *faster* | c'mon who is slow with Python (I am) |
| get familiar with the US layout (just for fun) | done, I now have an headache because I regularly switch from IT to US |
| rely less on third-party code ({*DIY*}-minus-{*don't reinvent the wheel*} ruleset) | kinda |
