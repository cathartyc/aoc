# Advent of Code

My own attempts to solve the AoC daily puzzles.

The goals for the 2023's edition are:
- solve the puzzles in Rust
- actually learn Rust by doing that
- most importantly, do not overburn over a problem: no one is gonna fry me for being late. I do not need a second job, I need to have fun

The goals for the 2022's edition were:

| Goal | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| solve the puzzles in Python 3.10 | done 14/25 |
| learn to write better 'pythonic' code | maybe done |
| do it *faster* | c'mon who is slow with Python (I am) |
| get familiar with the US layout (just for fun) | done, I now have an headache because I regularly switch from IT to US) |
| rely less on third-party code ({*DIY*}-minus-{*don't reinvent the wheel*} ruleset) | lol |
